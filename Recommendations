This is a list of recommendations to make this project better 
(UI, UX, Performance, Security, Architecture, Bug fix, New Feature, ...etc )

// Please make your recommendations as clear as possible with only a few sentences 

1. Don't tell the user if his/her password/email is wrong, just tell them 
that their credentials are wrong so you don't accidentally help anyone
trying to steal any account

2. use nodemon in the development, so when you save your code the application 
will re-run again

3. Add a database to the backend 

4. Do not return the password to the client

5. hashing passwords

6. enable sessions to save that the user logged in, 
currently when the user refreshes the page the session disappears

7. Add register functionality 

8. enable routing in the front-end application and split the front-end to a re-usable companents

9. maybe use webpack and install ( bootstrap - angularjs (1) ) locally and to stop using 
many script tags

10. Enable Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) in the express app
